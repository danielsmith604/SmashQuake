SmashQuake
==========

# What is it?

SmashQuake is a deathmatch Quake modification that uses Super Smash Bros. physics. It was originally programmed in 2008 using the both the progs106 (1996) and NewDM beta (1996) source code as a starting point. New mechanics were introduced like double jump and a completely different health mechanic where you start at 1 health and taking damage increases your health. The more health you have, the easier will be to knock you off the platform and fall to your death. This mod was only made possible back then because of the support of the Quake community with active playtesters, map creators, server hosts, and programmers that would help me when I was stuck. I plan to continue my work on SmashQuake to make it a complete mod focusing on both fun gameplay and easy accessibility.
